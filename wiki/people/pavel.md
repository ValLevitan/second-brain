# Pavel

Pavel (called "Pasha") is a JVL engineer on the Minsk team who works on system/driver and pipeline matters. On the Jan 17 DTP-53 call Aaron refers to him as an **engineering director** whose job is now to write specifications, not code. [[raw/dtp-53_action_builder_pipeline_definition_of_features_january_17_2025.md]]

## Role

- On the FP7 review, Val noted Pavel may need to search for more optimized Linux drivers, and gave Pavel and Alexander the undertaking to run further tests (with a measurement tool to find the performance bottleneck) before a follow-up meeting. [[raw/fp-7_performance_analysis_january_13_2025.md]]
- Pavel proposed the further testing needs a measurement tool or logs from browsers to show where video frames drop. [[raw/fp-7_performance_analysis_january_13_2025.md]]
- Attended the Jan 14 AI-assisted-development workshop. Aaron noted Pavel had built a couple of CI/CD YAML files by hand but is not yet fluent in them; Pavel had trouble cloning the repo and getting the AI tool's terminal working during the session. [[raw/ai-assisted_development_with_vs_code_git_and_mcp_january_14_2025.md]]
- Pavel wrote the pipeline-problem document that Aaron used as the seed input for the AI workshop demo. [[raw/ai-assisted_development_with_vs_code_git_and_mcp_january_14_2025.md]]

## Build-pipeline decision meeting (Jan 15)

- Pavel agreed with (and helped shape) the move to a Git-native build system. His key requirement: any build's config must be saved in Git so a shipped production build can later be rebuilt — e.g. as a debug build to investigate a problem. He argued games should be Docker volumes (mounted), not standalone images, to avoid overhead. [[raw/parameterization_in_the_development_pipeline_part_2_january_15_2025.md]] [[raw/parameterization_in_the_development_pipeline_part_3_january_15_2025.md]]
- Pavel favours submitting a non-instrumented build to GLI plus a procedure to install the instrumentation. [[raw/parameterization_in_the_development_pipeline_part_4_january_15_2025.md]]

## DTP-53 feature and FP7 testing (Jan 16–17)

- **DTP-53 (Jan 16–17):** Pavel owns the Git-native pipeline work as JIRA feature DTP-53. He first framed it as several separate per-model pipelines; Aaron then coached him to write proper customer-focused feature descriptions (installer pipeline, long-term artifact storage, GitHub configuration). His homework is to rewrite them as features (see the commitment on [[wiki/topics/build-pipeline-parameterization.md]]). [[raw/dtp-53_feature_planning_meeting_january_16_2025.md]] [[raw/dtp-53_action_builder_pipeline_definition_of_features_january_17_2025.md]]
- **FP7 bottleneck testing (Jan 17):** with Alexander, ran the deeper video-stream tests, translated between the Russian- and English-speakers, and concluded the bottleneck is the CPU. Pavel argued the key question is *where* the bottleneck is, and pushed to switch to the new Pixi engine version and to define which Omni components need continuous updates. His undertaking: check for a better Linux driver and revisit the Omni architecture (see [[wiki/decisions/2025-01-17-remain-on-fp7-hardware-ceiling.md]]). [[raw/fr-7_identifying_bottlenecks_in_performance_during_testing_january_17_2025.md]]

## South Dakota software and FlexPort beta (Jan 22–24)

- **South Dakota (Jan 22):** Pavel handles the Minsk software for the SD lab machine — the FutureLogic Gen 5/Gen 2 printer behaviour, the erroneous game-shutdown countdown, CRC validation, and printing via the Minsk SAS emulator. Val told him to contact Light & Wonder for logs but not to wait for them — to find the shutdown-trigger cause himself. See [[wiki/projects/south-dakota-vlt-market.md]] and [[wiki/decisions/2025-01-22-support-epic-950-printer-for-south-dakota.md]]. [[raw/sd_vlt_recap-jan-22-2025.md]]
- **FlexPort beta (Jan 24):** the FlexPort beta (~3 weeks out) and its assembled testing with FlexPay are attributed to Pavel's group; ticket validation is handled by FlexPay. See [[wiki/topics/jvl-machine-lineup.md]]. [[raw/flex_port_hardware_up-jan-24-2025.md]]

## GitHub repo structure (Feb 11)

- On the Feb 11 org-structure session Pavel ("Pasha") pushed the naming details (e.g. replace "OmniEngine" with the hardware-abstraction-layer "HAL"), agreed to restructure the Jira value streams to match the GitHub orgs, and confirmed he wants "as close an integration as possible" between Jira and GitHub. He flagged that the **FlexPay** project should be added to the first migration batch (Omni + Miranda). See [[wiki/decisions/2025-02-11-github-org-naming-and-structure.md]] and [[wiki/decisions/2025-02-11-git-migration-sequence.md]]. [[raw/Git_repo_structure_part_2_2025-02-11.md]]

## GitHub check-in and market alignment (Feb 12, Feb 19)

- **GitHub check-in (Feb 12):** attended as a reviewer ("Pasha") on Andrei's DevOps-repo pull requests and the repository-access discussion. See [[wiki/meetings/2025-02-12-github-check-in.md]]. [[raw/Check_in_on_GitHub_2025-02-12.md]]
- **Outstanding-subjects alignment (Feb 19):** Pavel is the technical owner across the market releases. He is injecting **Epic 950** printer support into the SD software (~end of next week) and will judge whether Epic Edge can be added; he taught Val the correct taxonomy — a printer's **firmware** sits on the printer, while JVL's side is a **hardware-abstraction-layer library**; the third printer connector is a **harness** (not a jumper); printer library types split into Gen 2 / Gen 5 (JCM) + nano-optics vs Epic. He proposed defaulting/relabelling the third COM port so operators can't misassign SAS ports. Val also pressed him on the English precision of "it seems to be working." See [[wiki/projects/south-dakota-vlt-market.md]] and [[wiki/projects/georgia-market-rollout.md]]. [[raw/Alignment_outstanding_subjects_2025-02-19.md]]

## Embedded group — connection debugging (Feb 25)

- On the Feb 25 embedded standup Pavel ("Pasha") is debugging why the FlexPort↔FlexPay **connection drops even though his ping-pong keepalive runs every second** and is received — cause unknown; he asked the JVL side to investigate, and noted the pings aren't showing in the logs. Val turned it into a design point: **detailed comms logging should be a formal requirement** (an enable-able log mode, as with Bally/Konami AFT); Pavel was cautious about always-on logs (too voluminous) but agreed a toggle-able mode is needed. See [[wiki/meetings/2025-02-25-embedded-group-flexport-flexpay.md]]. [[raw/Embedded_Group_alignment_and_update_2025-02-25.md]]

## The "Pavel replacement" automation idea (Feb 21)

- In a Feb 21 call Aaron used Pavel as the example of a role to automate: the step-by-step deployment/build flow Pavel performs could be baked into an MCP so an AI orchestrates it. See [[wiki/topics/ai-assisted-development.md]]. [[raw/Call_with_Aaron_Bockelie_2025-02-21.md]]

## Flex card reader, Incom, and game engineering (Feb 27–28)

- **Flex V42/C credit-card reader (Feb 27):** the full-insert credit-card reader is a **USB device**; Pavel already has a sample; it needs a **software** (not firmware) upgrade to drive it. See [[wiki/decisions/2025-02-27-flex-street-cabinet-design-direction.md]]. [[raw/Flex_V42_C_design_evolution_review_2025-02-27.md]]
- **Incom commissioning (Feb 27):** Val named Pavel as JVL's **Director of Engineering** and the engineering point of contact for the Incom payment-processor integration (with [[wiki/people/juan-martinez.md|Juan]] as first point of contact). See [[wiki/organizations/incom.md]]. [[raw/incomm_commissioning_plan_february-27-2025.md]]
- **Progressive per denomination (Feb 28):** Pavel's engineering group confirmed it is easier to add a progressive level **by denomination** on the **HG-6** CPU kits, removing the max-denom-only limit; committed to have it in ~2–3 weeks with an individual progressive per denomination. See [[wiki/decisions/2025-02-28-hg6-individual-progressive-by-denomination.md]]. [[raw/Game design part 1 - Feb-28-2025.md]]

## Open commitments

- [ ] Pavel — produce image files (e.g. an ext2/ext4 partition or a Docker/Docker-Compose image) that collect the modules for local deployment; full ISO assembly deferred to a later milestone — due by the next meeting (Monday) — [[raw/parameterization_in_the_development_pipeline_part_4_january_15_2025.md]]

Note: "Pasha" and "Sasha" are sometimes confused in the transcripts; "Pasha" maps here to Pavel, "Sasha" to Alexander Biratka. See [[wiki/people/alexander-biratka.md]]. His surname is given once as **"Frolov"** in the Jan 17 FP7 meeting ("Pavel Frolov has to see if there is a better Linux driver").
