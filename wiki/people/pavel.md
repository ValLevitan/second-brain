# Pavel

Pavel (called "Pasha") is a JVL engineer on the Minsk team who works on system/driver and pipeline matters.

## Role

- On the FP7 review, Val noted Pavel may need to search for more optimized Linux drivers, and gave Pavel and Alexander the undertaking to run further tests (with a measurement tool to find the performance bottleneck) before a follow-up meeting. [[raw/fp-7_performance_analysis_january_13_2025.md]]
- Pavel proposed the further testing needs a measurement tool or logs from browsers to show where video frames drop. [[raw/fp-7_performance_analysis_january_13_2025.md]]
- Attended the Jan 14 AI-assisted-development workshop. Aaron noted Pavel had built a couple of CI/CD YAML files by hand but is not yet fluent in them; Pavel had trouble cloning the repo and getting the AI tool's terminal working during the session. [[raw/ai-assisted_development_with_vs_code_git_and_mcp_january_14_2025.md]]
- Pavel wrote the pipeline-problem document that Aaron used as the seed input for the AI workshop demo. [[raw/ai-assisted_development_with_vs_code_git_and_mcp_january_14_2025.md]]

## Build-pipeline decision meeting (Jan 15)

- Pavel agreed with (and helped shape) the move to a Git-native build system. His key requirement: any build's config must be saved in Git so a shipped production build can later be rebuilt — e.g. as a debug build to investigate a problem. He argued games should be Docker volumes (mounted), not standalone images, to avoid overhead. [[raw/parameterization_in_the_development_pipeline_part_2_january_15_2025.md]] [[raw/parameterization_in_the_development_pipeline_part_3_january_15_2025.md]]
- Pavel favours submitting a non-instrumented build to GLI plus a procedure to install the instrumentation. [[raw/parameterization_in_the_development_pipeline_part_4_january_15_2025.md]]

## Open commitments

- [ ] Pavel — produce image files (e.g. an ext2/ext4 partition or a Docker/Docker-Compose image) that collect the modules for local deployment; full ISO assembly deferred to a later milestone — due by the next meeting (Monday) — [[raw/parameterization_in_the_development_pipeline_part_4_january_15_2025.md]]

Note: "Pasha" and "Sasha" are sometimes confused in the transcripts; "Pasha" maps here to Pavel, "Sasha" to Alexander Biratka. See [[wiki/people/alexander-biratka.md]]. His last name is not stated.
